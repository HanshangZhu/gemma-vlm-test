# Model Card: LlavaPythiaForCausalLM

## Model Details
The `LlavaPythiaForCausalLM` class extends the `GPTNeoXPreTrainedModel` and `LlavaMetaForCausalLM`. It is designed to handle causal language modeling tasks with additional capabilities for processing multimodal inputs, such as images, and generating actions based on different head types.

## Intended Use
This model is intended for use in robotics simulations, specifically within the MetaWorld environment. It can process both textual and visual inputs to generate actions for robotic agents.

## Training Data
The model is trained on datasets from the MetaWorld simulator, which includes a variety of tasks and scenarios for robotic agents.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics for language modeling and action prediction in robotics.

## Limitations
- The model may not generalize well to tasks outside the MetaWorld environment.
- It requires a GPU for efficient processing due to its complexity and multimodal capabilities.

## Ethical Considerations
- Ensure that the model is used in a manner that aligns with ethical guidelines for AI and robotics.
- Be aware of potential biases in the training data that could affect the model's performance.
